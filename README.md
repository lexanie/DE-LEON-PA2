# **EXPERIMENT 2: Numerical Python** <b>
## **DESCRIPTION** <b>
This notebook demonstrates the usage of NumPy. It includes two problems that focus on manipulating arrays and performing numerical operations: 

*1. Normalization Problem* 

*2. Divisible By 3* 
<b>

## REQUIREMENTS <b>
- Anaconda Navigator
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy library

## PROBLEM 1: NORMALIZATION PROBLEM 
This section covers the following steps:

1. Import the numpy
2. Generate a random 5x5 NumPy array X
3. Normalize X by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation
4. Save the normalized array as X_normalized.npy
5. Print the original and normalized arrays for comparison

## PROBLEM 2: DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM
This section covers the following steps:

1. Create a 10x10 NumPy array, where each element is the square of the first 100 positive integers
2. Identify and extract all elements that is divisible by 3
3. Save the extracted elements into a file named div_by_3.npy
4. Print the original array and the elements divisible by 3.
